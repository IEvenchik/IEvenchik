# Inga’s Operating Manual
I believe that a clear and inspiring vision in the hands of empowered teams yields tremendous results. As a product leader, I am relentless in seeking clarity and purpose to bring cohesion to my teams’ work. I thrive in environments where big ideas are welcome, risks are rewarded, and failures are seen as an opportunity for growth. I love seeing the big picture and connecting the dots between strategy and execution, but am just as comfortable focusing on the finest details to bring delight to my customers. 


## Things I know for sure  
* Work hard. Be nice. Laugh often. 
* Don't be aftraid to ask the obvious question; 9/10 times it’s not so obvious. 
* When problem-solving, few things beat a face to face conversation and a whiteboard. 
* Today is a good day for a good day. 

## My Leadership Philosophy
* I am continually inspired and motivated by [How Google Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oTVLjxBmik) 
* I may sit in the daily standup, but I am fully bought into the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) 
* I try to follow the tenants of [Servant Leadership]( https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/servant-leadership.htm)
 

## My Daily/Weekly Cadence
TOPIC | ANSWER
----- | -----
Most Productive Time of the Day | Late afternoon; evenings (4-10pm) 
Thinking (No Meeting Days) | Wednesdays 
Worst Day/Time for an intense 2 hr meeting | Before 10am  

## My Communication Channels
* I’m flexible in my communication methods, but favor chat for immediate, real-time asks, and e-mail for most everything else. 
* Whatever the method, please be concise and clear in your communication. I strive to do the same. 
* I tend to think visually so you’ll probably get drawings and diagrams from me.
* I will always provide an agenda for meetings that I schedule, and expect the same courtesy in return. 
* I frequently check e-mail / chat after hours, but I will not respond unless explicitly asked to do so, or in obvious cases of emergency.

## What engineering teams can expect from me as a Product Owner 
* I will set aggressive goals and ask a lot from you; I expect to negotiate scope to achieve a sustainable pace of delivery. 
* I will always have your back: our failures are MY failures; our successes are YOUR successes. 
* I am not technical by nature, but I am infinitely curious. I will ask you clarifying questions until I can explain the problem and solution in my own words. 
* I will share both positive and negative feedback from our customers so we can all have empathy and compassion as we design build our products. 


## What you can expect of me as an employee, and a colleague  
* I am dedicated and loyal, as long as I feel I have autonomy and purpose. 
* I will freely share my ideas even if they contradict yours, but I will "disagree and commit" for the greater good. 
* I take ownership for my goals, accomplishments, goals, and my mistakes. 
* I prefer to receive feedback in the moment; I want to course-correct as soon as possible. 

## My energy creators
* Brainstorming ideas and reaching that “aha” moment thru collaboration.
* Consolidating complex ideas into an engaging Power Point. (Yes, I believe they exist). 
* Learning something new whether it’s through a book, or a podcast, or a conversation. 
* Dancing , and poorly singing karaoke any chance I get. 


## My achilles heels (but actively working on ‘em)
* I think faster than I talk, so I sometimes speak too fast, or repeat myself.  Ask me to slow down when you notice this; it’s important for me to be an effective communicator. 
* I have high expectations of myself, and of others. This means I share feedback freely, but am flexible to accomodate your preferences for getting it. 
* I get very grumpy when I’m hungry. If I suddenly become silent or disengaged, suggest I get myself a snack! 

## Interests and hobbies outside of work 
* I am currently reading and translating my grandmother’s life story from Russian to English. 
* I share my birthday with Albert Einstein, and National Pi Day. This makes me a Pisces. 
* I performed at my first standup comedy routine at a (digital) open mic-night; I now actively jot down the hilarity of everyday life. 
* During current stay at home orders, I’ve discovered the simple joys of a casual (digital) poker game with friends. Oh, and puzzles! 
* I am grateful for my friends and family; maybe one day I’ll become more active on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/inga_evenchik/
)


## Other "Stuff"
* Once upon a time I used to be a graphic designer; I can still crank out an okay logo or T-Shirt design if put on the spot. 
* I’m a [Protagonist (ENFJ)personality type](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality) 
* I am [Enneagram Type Nine (The Peacemaker)](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9)
